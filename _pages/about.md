I am a 1st year MMath student at the University of Oxford, St. Hilda's college studying Mathematics and Statistics. Previously, I was at Simon Fraser University as a non-degree student under the concurrent studies program taking courses in mathematics and computer science. My primary research interests lie in dynamical systems, as well as in applying deep learning to practical challenges in biology and computer vision.

Previously, I was supervised by [Dr. Ben Ashby](https://ecoevotheory.com), where I developed stochastic simulations to study the virulence of evolution in a host-parasite model.
