## Experience 

I work at KTBYTE Computer Science Academy as a machine learning instructor, teaching "Intro to Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", and "Intro Data Science". I was the lead curriculum developer for the data science course and contributed to the deep learning curriculum as well. 

## Inquiries

I specialize in AP courses as well as university admissions consulting. I have experience in both writing essays myself and providing consultations to others. I was offered a full scholarship to study Computer Science at the Univeristy of Toronto, St. George Campus on their flagship [National Scholar program](https://future.utoronto.ca/national-scholarship/) and was offered admission to Brown University. Specifically, I tutor:

- AP Calculus AB/BC
- AP Computer Science 
- AP Statistics 
- US/UK admissions consultation
